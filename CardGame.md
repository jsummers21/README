The card game we should make should be Uno instead of Solitaire. The reason why the game should be Uno is because it meets more of the requirements of the project and Solitaire doesnt. An example can be that Uno can be played with 2 and more players while Solitaire is just a single player card game. As for the decks, both Uno and Solitaire have decks but Solitaire has too many to keep track of for us while Uno has 1 deck which is distributed into the players' hand and placed into the discard pile.
